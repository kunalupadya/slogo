Multiple Turtle Commands:
ID

Description:
ID values typically start at 1 and increase by 1 with each new turtle created;
There is technically only one "active turtle" at any given time since each command is run once for each active turtle; 
i.e., this value can always be used to identify the current turtle running the command

Parameters:
N/A

Returns:
Current active turtle's ID number
